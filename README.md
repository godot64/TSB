## Tuned Simons' BASIC

TSB is the attempt to provide a bug free and enhanced version of C64's well known Simons' BASIC. Almost
every main internal management routine and a whole bunch of commands have been debugged, shortened and
made stable for any use. Also, because of many left free spaces after that, quite a number of additional
commands could be implemented, so that in 1986 I had a real **new** Simons' BASIC I called **Tuned Simons'
BASIC**, TSB.

In 2019 I added a package of REU supporting commands and re-entered development of TSB. Had I tried to
leave TSB compatible to any extra software possibly written for Simons' BASIC in 1986, I now go for a
completely new TSB that only uses the known commands and their parameters but internally works on its
own which hopefully will provide faster performance.

Download TSB (on a zipped D64 file) from here: [TSB on a disk][TSB] or as a Magic Desk and a Uniprom [cartridge file][tsbcrt] for use with emulators like VICE.

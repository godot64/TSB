# VDCBasic TSB
There's an easy way to access the C128's said hard to handle second video chip VDC. It's a little C128 Basic 7 extension called **VDCBasic** (originally by Felix 'skOi!nk' Rosenhahn of the late 90s, then updated enhanced and newly coded by Marco Baye (of ACME Cross Assembler) in 2013 and 2014. VDCBasic provides 19 commands and functions to access the VDC without always having to care about this awful update mechanism via $d600. You just say "change this register" or "change this memory location" and that's it.

The command summary can be read on [TSB's Tips&Tricks site](https://www.godot64.de/TSB/vdcbasictsb.html#keywords "Link to VDCBasic TSB command summary") which is in German (translate by [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator "Link to DeepL translator")) and also provides some nice demo programs which show how to deal with the new commands. 

*VDCBasic TSB* is a port of this C128 based program to TSB on the C64. So, if you own a C128, run it in C64 mode, install *VDCBasic TSB* and have (for instance) a second video monitor showing text in 80 columns. Or displaying color images on the VDC, or whatever you have fun to test out and experiment with.
